I strive to be creative, organized, and dedicated. I will be the team leader for this project. It's always been an interest of mine to create useful applications. With this project, I hope to be able to promote awareness for smarter personal finance, and help people make better-informed decisions towards their financial goals. My responsibilities will include coordinating the team, creating our algorithms, and polishing the user interaction experience.
