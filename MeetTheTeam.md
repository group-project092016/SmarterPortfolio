##### Leonard Leong
######Creative / Organized / Dedicated 
I will be the team leader for this project. It's always been an interest of mine to create useful applications. With this project, I hope to be able to promote awareness for smarter personal finance, and help people make better-informed decisions towards their financial goals. As the team leader, I aim to involve myself in all aspects of the project. My primary responsibilities will be coordinating the team, creating our algorithms, and polishing the user interaction experience.

##### Riyesh Nath
######Innovative / Organized / Detailed 
I will be managing the database for this project. I have previously worked as a Data Engineer intern at Fidelity Investments with Fidelity Institutions (FI) which offers clearing, custody, investment products, brokerage and trading services to a wide range of financial intermediary firms. With this project, I hope to utilize and continue to develop my skill as a data engineer with a focus on financial services.  Though my primary focus will be managing and creating the database for our project, I will also be involved in creating a relaxed and robust user interface, and creating features that would allow a greater user experience.       
    
##### Joseph Lopez
With this project, I look forward to tackling new languages, and the challenges that go with it. I have some experience with designing android applications, as well as some backend programming with SQLite and C/C++. I expect to be working on some database integration, algorithm implementation, along with some web design.
