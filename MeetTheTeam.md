Members:

##### Leonard Leong
I'm Leonard Leong, and I will be the leader of this project. It's always been an interest of mine to create useful applications. With this project, I hope to be able to promote awareness for smarter personal finance, and help people make better-informed decisions towards their financial goals. My responsibilities will include scheduling the team, creating our algorithms, and polishing user interactions with our application.
